# Ocaml physics simulation 

A simple physics simulation built in OCaml, can be compiled to JS using the Bucklescript compiler.
Created in a TDD workflow. Tests written in ReasonML.

# Build

Currently only compiles the source without a generating an executable program.

`npm install && npm build`

# Run tests
